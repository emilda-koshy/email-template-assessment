Thought Process for Email Template

1. Structure
      I started by structuring the email using HTML to ensure a clean and organized layout. A container div is used to center the content and provide padding.

2. Styling
     I applied basic CSS styling to ensure readability and a professional appearance. This includes:
     Font selection (Arial) for a clean and modern look.
     Color choices to match Lloyds Bank's branding.
     Margin and padding adjustments for a neat layout.

3. Header
     The Lloyds Bank logo is included at the top of the email to maintain brand identity. The image is aligned left to best look as given format and given a maximum width for a consistent appearance.

4. Content
     The main content is organized with headings and paragraphs for clarity.

5. Accessibility
     The help section provides clear contact information and accessibility options.

6. Links
     Any links or phone numbers are made clickable for easy access. This includes the Relay UK service link and the phone number for customer support.
